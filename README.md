# My Portfolio!

## My Motivation:
My passion for art and technology inspired me to build this portfolio. Transitioning from a culinary career to web development, I aimed to create a platform showcasing my artistic skills and technical prowess. This project highlights my journey from chef to developer, combining my love for art and web design. It provides an online gallery for my artwork, demonstrating my web development skills and making my work accessible to a wider audience. This portfolio marks the beginning of my creative and professional journey. It will be regularly updated with new projects and artwork, reflecting my ongoing growth and development in web development and design.

Stay Tuned!
